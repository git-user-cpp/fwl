/// Displays the current iptables firewall filter table.
///
/// This function executes the `iptables -nvL` command to list the current rules in the iptables filter table.
/// It prints the output to the console, providing a detailed view of the active firewall rules.
/// This is useful for verifying the current state of the firewall configuration or for diagnostic purposes.
///
/// # Functionality
/// - Executes the `iptables -nvL` command, which lists all chains and rules in the filter table.
/// - Handles potential errors gracefully:
///   - If the `iptables` command cannot be executed (e.g., the binary is not found), it prints an error message to stderr and returns early.
///   - If the command executes but fails (e.g., due to permission issues or invalid options), it prints the command's stderr output in red for better visibility.
/// - Uses the `colored` crate to format error messages in red, enhancing readability.
///
/// # Output
/// - On success: Prints the output of `iptables -nvL` to stdout, prefixed with two newlines for better console formatting.
/// - On failure: Prints error messages to stderr, with errors highlighted in red.
///
/// # Error Handling
/// - If `Command::new("iptables").arg("-nvL").output()` fails (e.g., iptables is not installed), it catches the error and prints a message like "Failed to execute iptables -nvL: {}".
/// - If the command executes but returns a non-zero exit status, it prints "Error:\n" followed by the command's stderr output.
///
/// # Considerations
/// - This function assumes a Linux environment with `iptables` installed and available in the system's PATH.
/// - While listing iptables rules does not typically require root privileges, this program is designed to run with root access because it also includes functionality to modify firewall rules.
/// - For systems using nftables instead of iptables, this function may not work as expected, and alternative methods would be needed to display firewall rules.
/// - The use of `String::from_utf8_lossy` ensures that any invalid UTF-8 sequences in the command's output are handled gracefully, preventing panics.
///
/// # Notes
/// - This function is part of a larger command-line tool for managing iptables rules, where it is typically called after restoring rules to display the updated configuration.
/// - The two newlines (`\n`) before printing the output are added for better readability in the console, separating it from previous output.
